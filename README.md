This project is a perfume-based website.
There are three types of users: admin, guest, user.
I've made three admin pages:
  1)Admin homepage: that's a navigation page for himself
  2)Admin change product: the admin updates the existing products
  3)Admin statistics: products statistics only visible by the admin
One shopping cart page: details about the added products with numbered pages and a checkout.
One account settings page: change password/mail.
One page for guest and another one for user: view detailed product and add to cart.
